<h2>Internship Project ‚Äì PRONOBIS: Robotic Assistance for Prostate Interventions</h2>

<p>
As part of the research project <strong>PRONOBIS</strong>, my internship at CRTA focused on 
developing and evaluating <strong>robot-assisted solutions for prostate ultrasound planning and biopsy
automation</strong>. 
The goal was to ensure safe and precise interventions by optimizing robot‚Äìpatient positioning, 
anticipating involuntary patient motions, and implementing adaptive tracking strategies. 
Using the <strong>KUKA LBR iiwa 14</strong> and the <strong>KUKA Med 7</strong> robots, I explored kinematic analysis, manipulability, and motion feasibility 
to guarantee reliable performance during medical interventions.
</p>

<h3>üîπ Phase 1 ‚Äì Kinematic & Safety Analysis</h3>
As a first step, I carried out a detailed kinematic analysis of the KUKA LBR iiwa 14 robot to 
evaluate its suitability for prostate interventions. This included studying both forward and
inverse kinematics in order to establish the relationship between joint configurations and 
the end-effector position/orientation. Using Python and MATLAB Simulink, I analyzed the Denavit‚ÄìHartenberg parameters, computed the Jacobian matrix, and explored different methods for calculating and identifying singularities,
ensuring safe and efficient robot operation during medical procedures.


<h3>üîπ Phase 2 ‚Äì Mechanical Feasibility and Reachability analysis</h3>
<p>
To assess the mechanical feasibility and reachability of the KUKA robot during prostate interventions, 
I conducted an in-depth analysis combining simulation and algorithmic methods. Using the Reach ROS2 package, 
I generated reachability maps to visualize the robot‚Äôs dexterous workspace and identify optimal regions for 
safe operation.

To refine patient‚Äìrobot positioning, I applied a genetic algorithm that optimized placement while 
avoiding singularities and joint-limit risks.

In parallel, I developed a Python script that modeled the patient‚Äôs 
involuntary movements as a cuboid volume and evaluated whether the robot could safely follow these motions without
losing manipulability or entering unsafe configurations.

<h3>üîπ Phase 3 ‚Äì Patient mouvement simulation with the KUKA Med 7 & Patient Motion Tracking</h3>
<p></p>
For patient motion simulation and tracking, I used the KUKA LBR Med 7 robot to replicate involuntary movements 
such as breathing and minor prostate shifts. A mechanical support designed in SolidWorks and 3D-printed held the 
phantom securely while allowing controlled motion. Using ROS2 nodes, I generated translations and rotations in 
simulation (RViz) and on real hardware. The main KUKA LBR iiwa 14 robot employed torque sensors to measure interaction forces 
and feed them into a ForceCompensationNode, a PI-controller-based strategy in ROS2 that adaptively corrected the 
robot‚Äôs end-effector position in real time. This allowed the system to track patient motion precisely without 
external sensors, ensuring safe and accurate intervention throughout the procedure.

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
Through my work, I enabled the robot to safely follow patient-specific involuntary movements for real-time 
adaptive control. I also helped optimize robot placements using reachability maps and genetic algorithms 
to avoid singularities and joint-limit risks, ensuring safe and precise operation. 
This experience allowed me to gain hands-on expertise in manipulating KUKA robots, ROS2 programming, 
and working in a medical research environment, while understanding the critical role of precision and safety in robot-assisted prostate interventions.
